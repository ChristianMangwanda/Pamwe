# Pamwe Build Progress Summary

**Last Updated:** July 10, 2026

---

## ⭐ Where we are now (2026-07-10): LIVE ON TESTFLIGHT, couples beta running

**Apple Developer approved; App Store Connect record created; builds ship from the terminal** (xcodebuild archive → exportArchive upload; see trial-and-error.md "TestFlight beta round"). **Christian + Ammy are internal testers, paired as a real couple** (couple `955b0f3d…`) on the hosted project `jcyhhxgomhopkoqesbkb`. Sentry crash reporting live (DSN in `.env.production`/eas.json). `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set on hosted 2026-07-10 (old exposed key revoked) — Ask Pamwe live pending in-app verification.

**Builds 1–7 (all 2026-07-10):**
1. **b1** — first upload: real app icon (floral P), `.env.production` (hosted Supabase baked into Release builds).
2. **b2** — magic-link modal auto-dismiss; name-screen hang fixed (getSession + finally + loud zero-row update); onboarding libs on getSession; ALL em dashes removed from developer-authored copy (app + hosted DB + edge functions; scripture untouched); `CFBundleVersion` → `$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION)`.
3. **b3** — OAuth navigation fix: every sign-in success routes through the gate (Apple sign-in worked server-side but the UI never left the screen). New `sign-in.test.tsx` (7 scenarios). Dashboard side: Google/Apple providers enabled; Google needs **Skip nonce checks** ON (library can't pass the nonce).
4. **b4** — all remaining `getUser()` → `getSession()` across src/lib (was hammering /user ~7 req/s).
5. **b5** — **CoupleProvider staleness fix** (the root cause of the first beta's dead ends): realtime on couples/couple_plans + refresh() at invite/join/plan-select transitions; prayers spinner fix; join requires 6-char codes.
6. **b6** — Sentry enabled (crashes now self-report; recaps crash still undiagnosed, awaiting first report).
7. **b7** — Round 2 perf/UI: session caches + AsyncStorage stale-while-revalidate for the Plans grid; plan detail renders header before the 365-row schedule; schedule window centers on current day (fixes debug-tour #35); plan-detail CTA clears the tab bar; tab bar reproportioned (28px insets, 60px tall, radius 30) per Christian's screenshots.

**Feedback loop:** Christian logs beta findings in the Notion page **"Pamwe Ramblings"** (readable via the Notion MCP connector); triage → fix in batches → one build per round. Round-1/2 items all shipped.

**✅ ROUND 3 DONE: [`build8-plan.md`](build8-plan.md)** — b8 shipped to TestFlight 2026-07-10 and **verified live the same evening** (Christian: "major improvement, feels faster"; committed to main as 1c87587). The headline bug was an infinite push-token loop PATCHing /users at ~200 req/s; hosted API logs on b8 show exactly 2 launch-time PATCHes and zero errors, and Sentry has ZERO b8 events. All three b7 crashes (PAMWE-IOS-1/2/3 in org `zakia-12`, checked via the `sentry` CLI, not the MCP) were the same PATCH-storm memory exhaustion; they await a one-click resolve. ask-pamwe v6 (trimmed) live: first call 6.1s vs 7.1-12.8s on v5. Watch on b8: the never-captured b6 recaps crash; Ammy's phone still on b7 until she updates. Leftover triage from the round:
- **Verify on b7:** Ask Pamwe live answers; prayers realtime between both phones; tab bar feel; production push banner (checklist A6).
- **Watch Sentry** for the recaps crash + general crash reports.
- **Green list (Christian to rank):** nudge/poke partner push; more Bible translations (bible-api has ASV/YLT/Darby+); plan artwork (design call — striped banners are the current design); tree-growth streak (post-launch); whole-app copywriting pass ("sounds like AI"); Ask Pamwe discoverability in the Plans tab.
- **Standing rules:** NO em dashes in any user-facing copy (memory + ask-pamwe prompt enforce it); build numbers bump via `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` only.
- **Wide-launch items still open:** Supabase Pro upgrade + custom SMTP; Ask Pamwe rate limit; App Store Connect metadata/screenshots/privacy URLs; App Review demo-account strategy (see launch-checklist.md).

## Previous status (2026-07-09, pre-TestFlight)

**The design-handoff rebuild is CODE-COMPLETE — all 12 phases (0–11).** The app is the full 6-tab experience: Today · Bible · Plans · Prayers · Reflect · You, with light/dark theming, verse highlights/notes, a Plans catalog + custom-plan **builder with a live Claude-powered "Ask Pamwe"**, a Reflections history, and a You tab with recaps. `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; **59/59 Jest pass** across 7 suites. Feature work is done.

**What's left is all external / non-code:**
1. **Apple Developer Program — enrollment SUBMITTED 2026-07-09, awaiting Apple approval.** (Christian subscribed; will revisit on approval.) Unblocks: real APNs push banners, Sign In with Apple, TestFlight/App Store. Post-approval steps are staged in the "Apple Developer — post-approval checklist" below.
2. **On-device validation pass** on a physical iPhone (dark-mode visual, prayer swipe feel, voice record/upload/playback, two-device realtime, Ask Pamwe latency) — the whole app is verified in code + via DB/RLS tests, never run end-to-end on device.
3. **Rotate the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`** (it was pasted in chat 2026-07-08) and keep it in `supabase/functions/.env` (local) / `supabase secrets` (hosted).
4. **At launch:** apply the local-only migrations + plan seeds (Psalms/Cord/John + `plan_metadata.sql` + `20260708000005_prayers_author_delete.sql`) to the hosted project via MCP; re-enable the stripped iOS entitlements.

### Apple Developer — post-approval checklist (do when Apple approves)

1. `eas init` (interactive — needs Christian's Expo login) → stamps the EAS `projectId` into `app.json`, which also un-skips push-token registration in `src/lib/notifications.ts`.
2. Register the App ID `com.christianmangwanda.pamwe` with **Push Notifications** + **Sign In with Apple** capabilities; create an **APNs Auth Key (.p8)** → upload to Expo (`eas credentials`).
3. Re-enable entitlements (currently empty `<dict></dict>` in `ios/Pamwe/Pamwe.entitlements`): add `com.apple.developer.applesignin` + set `usesAppleSignIn`/push in `app.json`. The Apple-sign-in code already exists in `(auth)/sign-in.tsx`; all 4 push webhook functions already fire (just no banner today).
4. `eas build -p ios --profile development` → verify real push + Apple sign-in on device.
5. Real Pamwe app icon (still the Expo template default) before TestFlight; `eas build --profile production` → `eas submit`.

## Design-handoff rebuild (started 2026-07-08, code-complete 2026-07-09)

A finished high-fidelity design arrived in `design_handoff_pamwe/` (interactive prototype + tokens/motion spec). The app is being rebuilt to it phase-by-phase per the approved plan at `~/.claude/plans/let-us-create-a-ethereal-fairy.md` — data layer survives, view layer replaced, plus new features (6 tabs, dark mode, verse highlights/notes, Plans catalog + builder with Ask Pamwe AI, Reflections tab, You tab + recaps).

### Rebuild Phase 0 — Foundations: CODE-COMPLETE (2026-07-08)

- **Theme system:** `src/theme/tokens.ts` (light + dark palettes, design token names verbatim, swatches, GUTTER=26) + `src/providers/ThemeProvider.tsx` (`useTheme()`, AsyncStorage `pamwe:theme`, `Appearance.setColorScheme` sync). Context default = light tokens so unwrapped test renders keep working. Legacy `constants/colors.ts` frozen for un-migrated screens; deleted in rebuild Phase 11.
- **Typography:** Fraunces 500/500-italic/600 now loaded; design variants appended to `typeScale` (eyebrow/h1/h2/reader/cta/chip). Existing keys untouched (tests assert them).
- **Motion/haptics:** `src/lib/motion.ts` (fadeUp/overlayIn/sheetUp/popIn/unseal, exact prototype timings, `ReduceMotion.System`) + `src/lib/haptics.ts` (tap/light/medium/success/celebrate mapping the prototype's vibrate patterns).
- **Glass shell:** `ui/Glass.tsx` (GlassView on iOS 26+ via expo-glass-effect, BlurView + glass tint fallback), `GlassTabBar.tsx` (`useGlassTabOptions()` — floating radius-28 bar, press scale .88 + tap haptic, Phosphor fill/regular). Note: bottom-tabs types deep-import from `expo-router/build/react-navigation/bottom-tabs` (expo-router 56 vendors react-navigation; no public subpath).
- **New primitives:** `ui/Screen.tsx` (safe-area + 26px gutter + fadeUp + 118px bottom padding for the floating bar), `ui/SectionEyebrow.tsx`, `ui/Floral.tsx` (handoff PNGs copied to `assets/images/`, dark-mode tintColor). `ui/Text.tsx` now themes via `useTheme()`.
- **6-tab shell:** Today · Bible · Plans · Prayers · Reflect · You (Phosphor: SunHorizon/BookOpen/Books/HandsPraying/Feather/UserCircle). Plans/Reflect/You are styled stubs. Deleted the stale `(tabs)/prayers.tsx` route-collision stub. Settings/privacy/terms/delete-account moved from the Today stack to `(tabs)/you/` (links updated).
- **Fixes:** `getExpoPushTokenAsync` now reads the EAS projectId from Constants (skips with a warning if absent — was `projectId: undefined`); `GestureHandlerRootView` at root (for Phase 8 swipe); `app.json` `userInterfaceStyle` → `automatic`.
- **Native rebuild done:** expo-blur + expo-clipboard + phosphor-react-native installed; expo-modules-jsi patch re-applied cleanly; pods installed; **BUILD SUCCEEDED** to Christian's iPhone (iOS 27) and app installed via devicectl.
- **Gate:** `npx tsc --noEmit` clean repo-wide; 39/39 Jest tests pass.
- ⏳ **On-device smoke pending (Christian):** boot with Metro (`npx expo start --dev-client`), sign in, glass bar renders over scrolled content, tab haptics fire, core loop works, all 6 tabs reachable, Settings works under You.

### Backend moved to LOCAL Supabase for dev/testing (2026-07-08)

The hosted project `freftpwigrkjytusnqhx` hit its free-tier limit / paused. Decision (Christian): **run Supabase locally for testing, pay to host at launch.** Same stack, same code — only `.env` points elsewhere. This also unblocks magic-link testing (local emails land in Mailpit) and gives an always-available backend with no usage caps.

**Local stack is up and fully verified.** Docker + Supabase CLI (`brew`). `supabase start` runs Postgres/Auth/Realtime/Storage/Edge-runtime/Studio locally.

- **`.env` now points at local:** `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://10.0.0.205:54321` (the Mac's LAN IP so the physical iPhone reaches it over Wi-Fi; the dev client's `NSAllowsLocalNetworking` already permits cleartext to private IPs, so **no rebuild needed**). Local anon key set. **The hosted config is backed up in `env.hosted.backup`** (gitignored) — copy it back to return to hosted.
  - ⚠️ The URL is tied to the Mac's current LAN IP. If it changes (different Wi-Fi / new DHCP lease), update `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`. For the **simulator**, use `http://127.0.0.1:54321` instead.
- **Schema debt fixed — local migrations are now a complete, checked-in mirror of what prod had.** New migrations:
  - `20260607000000_local_remote_state_parity.sql` — reconstructs the remote-only changes: `couples.timezone`, `prayers.notify_partner`; SECURITY DEFINER helpers `current_user_couple_id` / `has_user_submitted_entry` / `can_view_partner_audio` + the **non-recursive** `users_select_partner` and `entries_select_partner_after_mutual_submit` policies (fixes the documented RLS recursion); `advance_plan_day_trigger` + `update_streak_on_mutual_submit_trigger`; the `voice-entries` storage bucket + 5 locked-reveal storage policies; realtime publication (entries/prayers/prayer_marks/couples/couple_plans); a locally-safe `notify_on_entry_submit` (no-op when `app.settings.*` GUCs are unset, so submission never depends on push wiring). **Streak logic is simplified locally** (increment/no-op/reset; no 30-day freeze bridging — a prod-only edge case). notify-new-prayer/notify-freeze webhooks omitted locally (push only).
  - `20260708000001_verse_marks.sql` — `verse_highlights` + `verse_notes` (per-couple shared study layer, recursion-safe RLS, indexes).
  - `20260708000002_prayers_category.sql` — `prayers.category` (family/health/work/guidance/thanks/other).
  - `20260708000003_plans_browse_metadata_and_custom_plans.sql` — plans browse/detail columns (tagline/about/explore/gain/labels/couple_id), `plan_days.passage_text` nullable, curated-public/custom-private RLS. **Curated-plan copy is content**, applied in `supabase/seeds/plan_metadata.sql` (runs after seed.sql; migrations run before seeds locally, so metadata can't live in the migration). On hosted, run that seed file's UPDATEs once via MCP.
  - `20260708000004_api_role_grants.sql` — explicit table grants for anon/authenticated (hosted gets these via default privileges; local needs them explicit or PostgREST 403s under RLS).
- **Dev data:** `scripts/local_dev_seed.sh` (idempotent) creates the two `__DEV__` sign-in users as **Christian** (`alice@pamwe.dev`, partner A) and **Ammy** (`bob@pamwe.dev`, partner B), password `dev-password`, pairs them (`America/New_York`), and enrolls them in M'Cheyne day 1. So the redesigned screens show real names.
- **Verified end-to-end** (via PostgREST with real JWTs): password sign-in works; `/entries` returns 200 (no recursion); plans expose the browse metadata; a highlight inserted by Christian is visible to Ammy (shared study layer); a categorized prayer by Ammy is visible to Christian. Storage bucket + 5 policies, 3 entry triggers, realtime on 5 tables all present.

**How to run the local backend (after a Mac reboot or `supabase stop`):**
```bash
supabase start                 # brings the stack back (data persists in the docker volume)
./scripts/local_dev_seed.sh    # only needed after a `supabase db reset` (reset wipes data)
npx expo start --dev-client    # then dev-sign-in as Christian or Ammy
```

**Local limitations (all acceptable for solo screen-by-screen dev):** Ammy can't test from her own location (backend lives on your Mac) — that needs hosting; real APNs push and Apple/Google OAuth don't work locally (use the dev sign-in). John plan + the 2 new curated plans (Psalms/Cord) are not seeded locally yet — generated in rebuild Phase 6.

**Not seeded locally yet:** Gospel of John (only M'Cheyne 365 is in seed.sql). Generate via `scripts/seed_john_plan.py` when rebuild Phase 6 needs the browse grid.

### Rebuild Phase 1 — Schema migrations: DONE locally (2026-07-08)

All Phase 1 schema is applied and verified on the local stack (see above). When launching, apply the same migrations to the hosted project via MCP + run `supabase/seeds/plan_metadata.sql`'s UPDATEs, then `get_advisors`.

### Rebuild Phase 2 — Onboarding & pairing reskin: CODE-COMPLETE (2026-07-08)

Full onboarding flow rebuilt to the design, reconciled with the real auth the prototype didn't have. Flow: **Welcome → sign-in → value-slides → name → pair-choice → invite | join → connected → (gate: plan-select → tabs).**

- **New screens** (copy verbatim from prototype): `(onboarding)/value-slides.tsx` (3 slides, progress dots, Skip), `name.tsx` (writes `users.display_name`/`avatar_initial` via new `updateDisplayName`), `pair-choice.tsx` (Invite / I-have-a-code option cards), `join.tsx` (code entry → `joinCouple` → connected), `connected.tsx` (overlapping pop-in avatars with real initials + "{me} & {partner}" line, `celebrate()` haptic).
- **Restyled:** `(auth)/welcome.tsx` ("Grow closer to God, together." + floral + two CTAs), `sign-in.tsx` + `magic-link.tsx` (theme pass; dev buttons now "Christian"/"Ammy"), `(onboarding)/invite.tsx` (real code from `createCouple`, idempotent reuse on relaunch, Copy via expo-clipboard + Share, spinning waiting, realtime → connected).
- **Intent flag:** welcome's "I have an invite code" stores `pamwe:onbIntent` so the funnel skips the value sell and lands on Join (read in value-slides + name). Minor deviation: pairing is mandatory (no "I'll do this later"), and welcome has no radial gradient (expo-linear-gradient not installed) — solid bg instead.
- **Primitives:** Button/Card/Avatar now theme via `useTheme()`; Button gains `dashed` variant + cta type + 17px padding; new `ui/BackLink.tsx` + `ui/Spinner.tsx` (rotating CircleNotch). Lib: `updateDisplayName` + `getMyProfile` in `account.ts`.
- **Gate rewired** (`src/app/index.tsx`): session+no-couple → value-slides; couple-not-paired → invite (shows code + waits); paired+no-plan → plan-select; paired+plan → tabs. `waiting.tsx` kept but superseded by invite.
- **Gotcha fixed:** the hosted-config backup `.env.hosted.local` broke Metro bundling (parsed as JS by the `.env*.local` glob) → renamed to `env.hosted.backup` (gitignored). Also regenerated the stale expo-router typed-routes manifest (Metro typegen) so the new routes typecheck.
- **Gate:** `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; 39/39 Jest pass.
- ⏳ **On-device:** not yet walked on the phone (deferred to the debugging pass, per plan).

### Rebuild Phase 3 — Today screen: CODE-COMPLETE (2026-07-08)

`(tabs)/(today)/index.tsx` rebuilt to the prototype: floral corner bleed + gear (→ `you/settings`), centered date eyebrow (real `new Date()` → "Monday · May 25") + "Day N" (34px serifLight) + italic plan title, ProgressBar with Day/total row, anchor verse card (current day's `pull_quote` + ref, big “ glyph at .2 opacity, flowers-divider), You/{partner} avatar row joined by a rose flowers-divider (statuses from `useTodayEntry`: Done / Reading… / Today; partner ring solid when done, dashed while waiting), 7-dot streak strip + "N day streak", state-aware CTA (Read Day N / Waiting for {partner} / Reveal together), and "Today's reading · {ref}" footer. Pull-to-refresh + restyled no-plan empty state kept.

- New `ui/ProgressBar.tsx` (line-2 track + accent fill). `ui/StreakBar.tsx` **replaced** — now a `count`-driven 7-dot strip (done=accent, upcoming=line-2); only Today consumed it.
- `reading.tsx` got the theme pass (BackLink, eyebrow/h2 tokens, flowers-divider, reader type, prompt card) — the full verse reader arrives in Phase 4.
- Partner name/initial from `CoupleProvider.partner`; my initial from `user_metadata.full_name` (dev users show "C"/"A"). Server stays source of truth — the CTA only navigates, never mutates day/streak.
- **Gate:** `tsc` clean; 39/39 Jest pass.

### Rebuild Phase 4 — Bible tab (reader, translations, marks): CODE-COMPLETE (2026-07-08)

Full Bible experience rebuilt: books → chapters → reader with translation switching, typography popover, reference-jump search, and the shared per-couple highlights/notes layer.

- **lib/bible.ts:** `Translation` type + `TRANSLATION_NAMES`; `fetchChapterVerses(book, chapter, translation)` (per-(book,chapter,translation) Map cache, whitespace-normalized verses); `fetchPassage(reference, translation)` (for NULL-text custom-plan days later); `parseReference(query)` (prototype regex, exact→despaced→prefix, chapter clamped, verse discarded). Removed the old `fetchBibleChapter`.
- **New lib/verseMarks.ts:** `getMarksForChapter`, `getAllMarks` (canonical-order sort), `setHighlight`/`clearHighlight` (upsert/delete), `saveNote`/`deleteNote`. Writes carry `user_id`; RLS scopes to couple.
- **New primitives:** `ui/SegmentedControl.tsx` (pill, used for translations + later recaps/appearance/builder), `ui/Switch.tsx` (custom track/knob), `ui/BottomSheet.tsx` (Modal scrim + sheetUp). **New `components/VersePassage.tsx`** — shared verse-by-verse renderer (nested Text, tap spans, swatch highlight bg, inline note mark; sizes 17/19/22/26 line-height 1.9); reused by Reflections later.
- **Screens:** `bible/index.tsx` (search + reference-jump card + "My highlights & notes" entry with live count + OT/NT lists), `bible/[book].tsx` (56×56 chapter grid), `bible/[book]/[chapter].tsx` (the reader: Chapters back, WEB/KJV/BBE SegmentedControl, "Aa" popover with size row + verse-numbers Switch + light/dark appearance calling `setMode`, optional plan-context banner via params, title + full translation name + flowers-divider, VersePassage with "Gathering the words…" + error/retry, Prev/Next, verse-tap → action-sheet BottomSheet with 4 swatches + clear + note preview → note editor), `bible/note.tsx` (modal editor, Cancel/ref/Save, empty text deletes), `bible/marks.tsx` (Notes + Highlights sections, canonical order, rows jump to chapter, empty state). Reader prefs persist to AsyncStorage (`pamwe:readerScale`, `pamwe:verseNums`).
- **Deviations:** verse auto-scroll/flash on jump from marks not implemented (RN flowing-text can't easily measure a verse position) — opening the chapter is the behavior. The note-pencil indicator is an inline "✎" glyph (SVG icons can't be inline children of RN Text).
- **New test:** `bible-parse.test.ts` (7 cases). **Gate:** `tsc` clean; **46/46 Jest pass**; all Phosphor icon names verified to resolve.

### Rebuild Phase 5 — Reflect flow (write → waiting → reveal): CODE-COMPLETE (2026-07-08)

The three ritual screens rebuilt to the design, all data/realtime/RLS logic preserved.

- **journal.tsx:** design write view — BackLink "Back to reading" (saves draft), "{plan} · {ref}" eyebrow, "Your reflection" h1, prompt card (surface-2, "Today's prompt" + italic prompt), textarea, lock hint "Hidden until you've both reflected.", "Share with {partner}" CTA (`medium()` haptic). **Voice kept** as a designed addition: the Write/Voice toggle is now a `SegmentedControl`; voice mode shows the prompt card + VoiceRecorder. Autosave, submit, and the voice upload pipeline are unchanged.
- **waiting.tsx:** `popIn` check circle, "Your reflection is in.", sealed-until-both copy, a "{partner} is reading…" card (dashed avatar), "Back to Today" CTA. Realtime subscription + 30s fallback poll + auto-route to reveal kept.
- **reveal.tsx:** "Revealed together" eyebrow, "What you each wrote" h1, ref, flowers-divider, two cards entering with `unseal(0)`/`unseal(1)` (staggered 160ms), `success()` haptic on unlock. CTA **"Amen · mark day complete"** (HandsPraying icon) is **acknowledgment only** — it calls `CoupleProvider.refresh()` then routes to the completion screen on the final day or home otherwise; **no client mutation of current_day/streak** (the DB trigger owns advancement). Voice entries render `AudioPlayer` inside the card; loading + "couldn't load" retry states kept.
- **Voice components themed:** `AudioPlayer` + `VoiceRecorder` now consume `useTheme()`; play/pause glyphs (▶/❚❚) replaced with Phosphor `Play`/`Pause`. All recording logic (metering waveform, 5-min auto-stop, permissions, playback) untouched.
- **Gate:** `tsc` clean; Jest green.

### Rebuild Phase 6 — Plans tab, plan detail, 2 new seeded plans: CODE-COMPLETE (2026-07-08)

Plans browse + detail built to the prototype, and the browse grid now has real content: two new curated plans seeded (**placeholder content — pull quotes/titles/prompts are original starting points for Christian's editorial pass, WEB passage text is public-domain**). John also seeded locally so the grid has four plans.

- **Seeds (new scripts, `seed_john_plan.py` pattern — offline bible-api WEB fetch → idempotent SQL, fixed UUIDs):**
  - `scripts/seed_psalms_plan.py` → **Psalms of Comfort (30 days)**, id `c1b2c3d4-…892`. Curated 30-psalm arc through the emotional weather of a shared life; per-day title + chosen pull-quote verse + couples reflection prompt authored.
  - `scripts/seed_cord_plan.py` → **A Cord of Three Strands (21 days)**, id `d1b2c3d4-…893`. Ecclesiastes 1–12 then a curated companionship arc (Gen 2, Ruth 1, Prov 27, Song 8, John 15, 1 Cor 13, Eph 4, Col 3, 1 Pet 3) — deliberately fixes the prototype's canon-drift into Song of Songs. Applied to local DB; verified 30/30 + 21/21 `plan_days`, pull quotes single-line, RLS-readable by an authenticated dev user.
  - `supabase/seeds/plan_metadata.sql` extended with Psalms + Cord browse/detail copy (tagline/about/explore/gain/labels), lifted from `planLib`. **On hosted: run all three seed SQLs + the two new metadata UPDATEs via MCP.**
- **`src/lib/plans.ts`:** `getCuratedPlans()` (curated only, duration asc so M'Cheyne 365 is last), `getCouplePlans(coupleId)` (custom plans — empty until the builder in Phase 7), `getPlan(id)`, `getPlanDayList(id)`, `completePlan(couplePlanId)`.
- **New `ui/StripedBanner.tsx`** — the prototype's diagonal 45° striped banner as an SVG userSpace pattern (react-native-svg), sized to measured width, unique `useId` pattern id. Used by plan cards, detail banner, and plan-select.
- **`plans/index.tsx`** rebuilt: "Reading now" hero (striped banner + italic title + progress + Day N of M + View plan), "Your plans" (custom, hidden when empty), "Browse more" 2-col curated grid, dashed "Build your own plan" (→ friendly "coming soon" until Phase 7). Pull-to-refresh + `useFocusEffect` reload.
- **New `plans/[id].tsx`** (`overlayIn`): striped banner + floral + back, meta row (days / scripture / minutes), About, **Reading schedule** windowed to 40 rows (done `< current_day` / current / upcoming, live from `plan_days`; rows tap → Bible reader via `parseReference`, with plan context for the active plan), explore (numbered) + gain (surface-2 card), footer CTA "Continue reading" (active) / "Begin together" (enroll or confirm-switch), secondary "Mark plan complete" (active only → `completePlan` → plan-select). `plans/_layout.tsx` registers `[id]`.
- **`plan-select.tsx`** restyled to the theme + `StripedBanner` browse cards (was legacy `constants/colors`); now reads `getCuratedPlans()`.
- **Deviations:** builder is Phase 7 (dashed button alerts "coming soon"); "Mark plan complete" routes to plan-select rather than the `complete.tsx` celebration (that screen needs an active plan, which marking-complete removes); the Plans-header magnifier is decorative (search lives in the Bible tab).
- **Gate:** typed-routes manifest regenerated (new `plans/[id]`); `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; **46/46 Jest pass**; data layer verified through PostgREST with a real dev-user JWT.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Open questions for Christian (Phase 6):**
> 1. **Hosted apply of the new plans is pending.** The two new plans + John are seeded to the **local** DB only. At launch, apply `/tmp/psalms_seed.sql`, `/tmp/cord_seed.sql`, `/tmp/john_seed.sql` (regenerate with the scripts) **and** the two new `plan_metadata.sql` UPDATEs to the hosted project (`freftpwigrkjytusnqhx`) via MCP. **Q: apply to hosted now, or leave local-only until the launch migration pass?** (Left local-only for now, matching the current dev setup.)
> 2. **"Mark plan complete" routes to plan-select, not the `complete.tsx` celebration.** Marking complete removes the active plan, and `complete.tsx` reads an *active* plan for its stats — so the manual-complete path currently lands on plan selection instead of the celebration. **Q: acceptable, or should manual-complete also show a celebration?** (Would need `complete.tsx` to accept a just-completed plan id/stats rather than reading the active one.) The automatic final-day completion (via the reveal screen) still reaches `complete.tsx` normally.

### Rebuild Phase 7 — Plan builder + real Ask Pamwe (Claude API): CODE-COMPLETE (2026-07-08)

The build-your-own-plan flow, with a real Claude-powered recommendation feature. Uses Christian's Anthropic developer account (API key via edge-function secret).

- **Edge function `supabase/functions/ask-pamwe/index.ts`** — user-invoked (**`verify_jwt = true`**, added to `config.toml` under `[functions.ask-pamwe]`; deploy hosted with the same). `import Anthropic from "npm:@anthropic-ai/sdk"`; model from env `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` (**default `claude-haiku-4-5`** — Christian's choice; Haiku 4.5 supports structured outputs), key from `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. **Structured output** via `output_config.format` (json_schema — note: the `format.name` sub-field is rejected by the API, omit it) so parsing can't fail: `{ recommendations: [{ title, meta, days(7|14|21|30), rhythm(verses|chapter|deep), readings:[{day,reference}], prompts[] }] }`, 2–3 recs. `thinking: disabled` (fast), `max_tokens 4096`. Validates query ≤ 300 chars → 400; missing key → friendly 503; refusal/errors → friendly 502. **Verified LIVE end-to-end** (real key in `supabase/functions/.env`) on both Sonnet 5 and Haiku 4.5 — returns 3 well-formed, contextual recommendations. Built against the `claude-api` skill, not from memory.
- **`src/lib/askPamwe.ts`** — `askPamwe(query)` via `supabase.functions.invoke('ask-pamwe')`. Normalizes each rec: drops readings whose book fails `parseReference`, renumbers days, derives `days` from what survived. **On any failure (missing key, network, refusal, all-invalid) falls back to hardcoded "gentle starting points"** (John 21 / Psalms-of-comfort 14 / Way-of-Love 7) — so the builder works end-to-end even before the key is set.
- **`src/lib/planBuilder.ts`** — `generateSchedule(startBook, startChapter, days)` (pure canon walk over `BIBLE_BOOKS`, clamped at Revelation 22) + `createCustomPlan(coupleId, {name, days, readings, prompts?, ...})` (inserts a `plans` row `is_curated=false, couple_id, created_by` + N `plan_days` with `passage_text = NULL`, prompts or a rotating generic set). Client-side, no edge function.
- **`plans/builder.tsx`** — single screen, 4 internal steps + success (`overlayIn`, step dots). Step 1: Books / Topics / **Ask Pamwe** SegmentedControl (books = searchable `BIBLE_BOOKS`; topics = themed chips that call Ask Pamwe; ask = free-text → recommendation cards). Step 2: length 7/14/21/30 with a "Recommended" badge on the AI pick. Step 3: rhythm (verses/chapter/deep) + "Reflect together" Switch (rendered for fidelity; **v1 stores rhythm as a label only** — deviation). Step 4: name + review → `createCustomPlan` → `popIn` success (View plan / Done). Wired to the dashed "Build your own plan" button (was a "coming soon" alert) + registered route.
- **Custom-plan readability closed a gap:** `(today)/reading.tsx` now **live-fetches NULL-`passage_text` days** via `fetchPassage` (loading + retry states), so builder-made plans read correctly in the daily ritual — not just via the Bible reader.
- **New test** `src/__tests__/plan-builder.test.ts` (6 cases: within-book walk, book-boundary crossing, canon-end clamp, mid-book start, unknown-book fallback, exact length). **Gate:** typed-routes regenerated (new `plans/builder`); `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; **52/52 Jest pass**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **To turn Ask Pamwe live (Christian):**
> - **Local:** create `supabase/functions/.env` (gitignored; template at `.env.example`) with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-…`, then `supabase functions serve ask-pamwe --env-file supabase/functions/.env`. The running `supabase start` stack does **not** hot-serve a newly-added function — serve it explicitly (or restart the stack).
> - **Hosted (at launch):** `supabase secrets set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=…` and `mcp__supabase__deploy_edge_function` with `verify_jwt: true`.
> - The builder's Ask Pamwe / Topics modes gracefully use the fallback recs when the key/function is absent; Books mode is fully offline. **Key note:** it was pasted in chat — rotate it and update `supabase/functions/.env`.

### Rebuild Phase 8 — Prayers upgrade: CODE-COMPLETE (2026-07-08)

The Prayers tab rebuilt to the design: categories, swipe actions, a detail sheet, and a compose/edit flow with a live notification preview.

- **Migration `20260708000005_prayers_author_delete.sql`** — adds an **author-only DELETE** policy on `prayers` (there was none — delete was RLS-blocked). UPDATE stays couple-scoped so either partner can mark a shared prayer answered; text/category editing is UI-gated to the author. Applied locally + mirrored; **hosted needs it too.** **RLS verified with both dev accounts:** category persists cross-account, Ammy's delete of Christian's prayer is blocked (row survives), Ammy *can* mark it answered, Christian can delete his own.
- **`src/lib/prayers.ts`** — `PrayerCategory` type + `PRAYER_CATEGORIES`/`CATEGORY_LABEL`; `createPrayer(..., category)`, new `updatePrayer(id, text, category)` + `deletePrayer(id)`.
- **New `ui/CategoryChip.tsx`** (surface-2 pill, accent2 label) + **`NotificationPreview.tsx`** (black mock iOS banner; reused by recaps in Phase 10).
- **`PrayerCard.tsx` rebuilt** — themed; **swipe-left on own prayers** (`Gesture.Pan` + reanimated, `activeOffsetX([-10,10])` so scroll wins, snap open −140 past −70 with `medium()` haptic) revealing Edit/Delete; Avatar + name + relative time + CategoryChip header; **directional prayed row** (own prayer → read-only "{partner} prayed / Waiting for {partner}"; partner's → my "I prayed today" toggle). `relativeTime()` helper exported.
- **New `PrayerDetailSheet.tsx`** (BottomSheet) — text, category, prayed status, "Mark as answered", Edit/Delete for own; answered prayers show the note.
- **`prayers/index.tsx` rebuilt** — "Add a prayer point" CTA, rose Floral divider, active cards, "Answered · N" archive section, hands-praying empty state, pull-to-refresh, realtime kept; card + sheet wired to mark-answered/edit/delete (optimistic + reload). **`add.tsx` rebuilt** as compose **and edit** (opened with `editId`/`text`/`category` params): "Your prayer" textarea (280), category chips, "Let {partner} know" Switch + live `NotificationPreview` (create only). `prayers/_layout.tsx` themed.
- **Gate:** `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; **52/52 Jest pass**.
- ⏳ **On-device (Christian):** swipe feel + scroll-vs-swipe on a physical iPhone; category persistence across the two accounts in the live UI; the notification banner still won't deliver on the free Apple ID (webhook fires, no banner) — unchanged.

### Rebuild Phase 9 — Reflections tab: CODE-COMPLETE (2026-07-08)

The shared history of revealed reflections — list, book filters, and a detail view.

- **New `src/lib/reflections.ts`** — `getRevealedReflections(coupleId)` selects the couple's submitted entries and **groups by `(couple_plan_id, day_number)`, keeping only mutual pairs.** The locked-reveal RLS already hides a partner's entry until both submit, so a day is "revealed" exactly when two entries are visible; a non-mutual day surfaces only my own entry and is dropped. Batch-fetches `plan_days` (reference/title) + plan titles, derives the `book` (via `parseReference`) for filtering and a text `snippet`, sorts newest-revealed first. `getReflectionDetail(couplePlanId, day)` re-fetches the plan day + both entries fresh for the detail screen. **RLS premise verified with both dev accounts:** Christian-only submit → he sees 1 entry (excluded); after Ammy submits → 2 visible (included). Test data cleaned up.
- **`reflect/index.tsx` rebuilt** (was a stub) — floral corner, "Reflections" + italic subtitle, derived **book filter chips** (shown when >1 book), reflection cards (date · reference eyebrow, overlapping You/partner avatars, italic snippet, book chip + "Read →"), feather empty state, pull-to-refresh, `useFocusEffect` reload. Rows → detail.
- **New `reflect/[id].tsx`** — BackLink, date·reference eyebrow + italic title + "Day N · {plan}" + flowers-divider, "The passage" card (seeded `passage_text`, or **live-fetch when NULL** for custom plans, with loading/error), then "What you each wrote" — two cards (mine outline-avatar / partner filled-avatar) rendering text or the themed `AudioPlayer` for voice entries. Route registered in `reflect/_layout.tsx`.
- **Gate:** typed routes regenerated (`reflect/[id]`); `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; **52/52 Jest pass**.

### Rebuild Phase 10 — You tab, recaps, dark mode ships: CODE-COMPLETE (2026-07-08)

The You tab, period recaps, and **dark mode goes user-visible** — which made this the dark-mode QA sweep (theming the last legacy screens).

- **Lib:** `entries.ts` — `countMyTotalSubmitted(coupleId)` (my submitted → "Days read") + `countCoupleReflections(coupleId)` (all visible submitted → "Reflections"). `prayers.ts` — `countPrayers(coupleId)`. **New `src/lib/recaps.ts`** — `getRecap(coupleId, timezone, 'week'|'month'|'quarter')` runs client queries over existing tables (my entries in range → days + "What you read" references; verse_highlights count; prayers in range → "What you prayed for"), with **deterministic headline/"learned" templates — no LLM over private reflections in v1**. Pure testable `recapCutoffISO()` (rolling N-day window; v1 deviation: not timezone-exact calendar boundaries).
- **`you/index.tsx` rebuilt** (was a stub): floral corner, profile (64px avatar, name, "Walking with {partner} · N day streak"), **3 stat cards** (Days read / Reflections / Prayers, live counts on focus), **Appearance Light/Dark toggle → `setMode`** (Sun/MoonStars; this is where dark goes user-visible), Settings group (Notifications, Change reading plan, Your recaps, You & {partner}), About group (Privacy, Terms), Sign out confirm, WEB attribution footer.
- **New `you/recaps.tsx`** — Week/Month/Quarter SegmentedControl, range label + headline, 3 stat cards (Days read / Highlights / Prayers), "What you read / learned / prayed for" cards, "Sent to you both" `NotificationPreview` (delivery still APNs-blocked — mock only). **New `you/couple.tsx`** — overlapping-avatar couple card, sealed-reveal privacy note, "Delete my account" → existing delete flow. Both routes registered.
- **Dark-mode sweep:** theme-passed the last legacy `constants/colors` screens — `you/settings.tsx` (notif prefs), `you/privacy.tsx`, `you/terms.tsx`, `you/delete-account.tsx`, `(today)/complete.tsx` (TwineDivider → Floral), and the `(today)`/`(auth)` stack layouts. **Every signed-in surface now themes via `useTheme()`.** Remaining `constants/colors` users are onboarding-only/pre-auth (`(onboarding)/waiting.tsx`, `PamweWordmark`, `TwineDivider`) where the dark toggle isn't reachable — Phase 11 deletes `constants/colors`.
- **Gate:** typed routes regenerated (`you/recaps`, `you/couple`); `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; **56/56 Jest pass** (new `recaps-dates.test.ts`); You-tab/recap queries verified against real RLS (no column errors). ⏳ **On-device:** the actual dark-mode *visual* check (floral tint, highlight ink stays `#2B1F14`, glass tint, keyboard/alert appearance) still needs a real iPhone — the sweep here is code-level theming completeness.

### Rebuild Phase 11 — Cleanup, tests, docs: DONE (2026-07-09) — **amended: no new features, colors.ts kept**

> **Plan amended (Christian):** Phase 11 is finishing hygiene only. The two dropped items: (1) the `complete.tsx` "certificate" rebuild (Floral confetti / `Share.share` / seal) — net-new feature, skipped; `complete.tsx` already works and is themed. (2) Deleting `src/constants/colors.ts` — **kept, frozen.** It stays a light-only palette for the pre-auth/onboarding stragglers (`(onboarding)/waiting.tsx`, `PamweWordmark`, `TwineDivider`) + `ui-components.test.tsx`; those aren't reachable with the dark toggle on. Rule: never import it in new code — use `useTheme()`.

- **Tests:** `ui-components.test.tsx` gained a **theme-switch test** (renders `ThemeProvider`, `setMode('dark')` → themed Text recolors light ink `#2B1F14` → dark ink `#EFE6D6`, exercising the whole theme system), a dashed-Button border test, and a SegmentedControl `accessibilityState` test. Fixed the shared AsyncStorage mock in `setup.ts` (missing `__esModule: true` double-wrapped the default import — first surfaced now that a test mounts `ThemeProvider` directly). Pure-function suites all present: `bible-parse`, `plan-builder`, `recaps-dates`.
- **Accessibility pass:** `accessibilityRole="button"` + `accessibilityState={{ selected }}` added to every selectable chip/card group (builder length/book/rec, prayer category chips, reflect book filters, plan-select cards; SegmentedControl + You appearance toggle already had it). Icon buttons already carry labels/text; reduced-motion honored globally (all `motion.ts` keyframes use `ReduceMotion.System`).
- **Docs:** root `CLAUDE.md` updated — 6-tab route map, theming (`useTheme()`/tokens + frozen `colors.ts` warning), expanded data-model (custom plans, nullable `plan_days.passage_text`, `prayers.category`, `verse_highlights`/`verse_notes`), `ask-pamwe` edge function + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret, and the new lib modules in "Where to find things."
- **Gate:** `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; **59/59 Jest pass** (7 suites).

**The design-handoff rebuild (Phases 0–11) is code-complete.** What remains is external/on-device, not feature work: the physical-iPhone validation pass (dark-mode visual, prayer swipe feel, voice record/upload/playback, two-device realtime, Ask Pamwe latency), Apple Developer enrollment (**submitted 2026-07-09, awaiting approval**), rotating the pasted `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, and applying the local-only migrations/seeds to the hosted project at launch.

---

> ⚠️ **Everything below this line is the ORIGINAL pre-rebuild history (the 2-tab app, phases 1–8).** It's kept for the debugging/decision trail, but the authoritative current status is the **⭐ Where we are now** banner at the top plus the rebuild Phase 0–11 entries above. Where the two disagree, the top wins (e.g. plans are now 4 curated + a custom builder; build-your-own is shipped; tests are 59/59, not 39/39).

**Current State (pre-rebuild snapshot):** Phases 1–6 are code-complete. The full feature set is built and backed by the live Supabase project (`freftpwigrkjytusnqhx`): the daily ritual + locked reveal, voice journaling, timezone-aware streaks with silent freezes, the Bible browser, the Prayers tab (Phase 5), and the Phase 6 "completeness" layer — plan completion, a real Settings screen, account deletion, couples realtime, and the freeze "fresh start" ping. Typecheck is clean on app/lib files and 39/39 Jest tests pass. **The gating work now is on-device validation, not feature-building** — the core flows (voice reveal, account deletion both directions, plan completion, notification recovery) have only been verified in code and via transactional DB tests, never run end-to-end on a physical iPhone. Real APNs push remains blocked on Apple Developer enrollment.

### At a glance — what's done vs. what's left

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Auth (magic link + Apple + dev users) | ✅ Built. Magic-link-via-real-email not validated end-to-end. |
| Couple pairing + onboarding | ✅ Built. Now realtime (Phase 6), was polling. |
| Reading plans (M'Cheyne 365, John 21) | ✅ Both fully seeded. Switch-plan + completion flow done. |
| Daily ritual + locked reveal | ✅ Built. Not yet run end-to-end on device. |
| Voice journaling + storage RLS | ✅ Built. Mic/upload/playback need a real iPhone. |
| Streaks + silent freezes + fresh-start ping | ✅ Built + DB-tested. |
| Bible browser tab | ✅ Built. |
| Prayers tab (Phase 5) | ✅ Built. Not yet run on device. |
| Settings (sign out / plan / notif prefs) | ✅ Built (Phase 6). |
| Account deletion (demote routine) | ✅ Built + DB-tested. Both directions need device test. |
| Plan completion screen | ✅ Built + DB-tested. |
| Apple Developer / APNs / TestFlight | 🟡 **Enrollment submitted 2026-07-09, awaiting Apple approval.** Post-approval checklist in the top banner. |
| Build-your-own-plan UI | ✅ Built in rebuild Phase 7 (Plans builder: Books / Topics / Ask Pamwe). |
| Ship Prep (now Phase 7) | 🔶 Started 2026-06-10 — eas.json, Sentry (env-gated), error states, privacy/terms, onboarding polish, a11y. |
| Launch (Phase 8) | ⏳ Not started (gated on Apple approval). |

## Phase 1 — Foundation (Weekends 1–2): COMPLETE

### Weekend 1: Scaffold & Auth

- **Project scaffold:** Expo SDK 56, TypeScript, file-based routing (expo-router), React 19.
- **Dependencies:** Supabase JS, AsyncStorage adapter, Apple Authentication, deep linking, Google Fonts (Fraunces + Instrument Sans).
- **Design system:** Color tokens, typography tokens, UI primitives (Text, Button, Card, TwineDivider, Avatar, StreakBar, PamweWordmark).
- **Supabase client:** AsyncStorage adapter, session persistence, `detectSessionInUrl: false`.
- **Auth flow:** `AuthProvider`, `useAuth` hook, deep link handler in root layout.
- **Auth screens:** welcome, sign-in (magic link + Apple Sign In), magic-link confirmation.

### Weekend 1 (continued): Database

- Project ID `freftpwigrkjytusnqhx`, `.env` configured.
- 8 tables, RLS on all: `users`, `couples`, `plans`, `plan_days`, `couple_plans`, `entries`, `prayers`, `prayer_marks`.
- Locked-reveal RLS enforced at Postgres level (not client).
- `idx_entries_reveal_lookup` for the self-join.
- `handle_new_user` trigger auto-creates `public.users` on Auth signup.

### Weekend 2: Couple Pairing & Onboarding

- `src/lib/couples.ts` — invite code generation (6-char alphanumeric, no ambiguous O/0/I/1), 7-day expiry, join validation, self-join prevention.
- Onboarding screens: dual-path invite + waiting (polls every 10s + on foreground).
- Auth gate in `src/app/index.tsx` routes through 5 states.

### Test Suite (foundation)

- Jest + jest-expo + @testing-library/react-native.
- 30 tests, 3 suites: couples (15), AuthProvider (6), ui-components (9).

---

## Phase 2 — The Daily Ritual (Weekends 3–4): COMPLETE

### Weekend 3: Reading Plan Engine

- **M'Cheyne Reading Plan:** 365 days, Family Worship column from PLAN2.pdf. Replaced original 3 curated plans.
- **WEB Bible text:** All 365 passages from bible-api.com (public domain) → `supabase/seed.sql` (14,281 lines).
- **Pull quotes:** Auto-extracted compelling verse (40-200 chars) per day.
- **Reflection prompts:** 30 rotating couples-focused prompts.
- **Plan-select screen:** Shown after pairing if no active plan.
- **Lib + providers:** `src/lib/plans.ts`, `src/lib/entries.ts`, `CoupleProvider`, `useTodayEntry`.

### Weekend 4: Reading & Text Journal

- Tab layout: Today + Prayers (Prayers placeholder).
- Today stack: home → reading → journal → waiting → reveal.
- Text journaling with 5s autosave, character count, send confirmation.

---

## Phase 3 — The Magic (Weekends 5–6): COMPLETE

### Weekend 5: Locked Reveal (Realtime)

- `postgres_changes` subscription on waiting screen, filtered by `couple_plan_id`. 30s fallback poll.

### Weekend 6: Push Notifications

- `expo-notifications` + `expo-device` installed; plugin in `app.json` with oxblood accent.
- `src/lib/notifications.ts`: `registerForPushNotifications`, `savePushToken`, `scheduleMorningNotification`.
- 6:30 AM morning ping scheduled in root layout.
- `notify-partner` Edge Function source written.

### Phase 3 Deployment (completed 2026-05-28 via Supabase MCP)

- ✅ Deployed `notify-partner` Edge Function (verify_jwt=false, webhook target).
- ✅ Database trigger `notify_partner_on_submit_trigger` on `entries`, fires `net.http_post` when `submitted_at` transitions NULL → set. Migration: `enable_pg_net_and_notify_partner_webhook`.
- ✅ Realtime enabled on `public.entries` (added to `supabase_realtime` publication).
- ✅ Trigger function locked down (`REVOKE EXECUTE ... FROM PUBLIC`).

---

## Phase 4 — Voice & Streaks (Weekends 7–8): COMPLETE (code-complete; voice flow device-validation pending)

### Phase 4 prep — Storage RLS for voice entries (completed 2026-05-28)

- ✅ `couples.timezone` column added (default `'UTC'`). Captured at couple creation in `src/lib/couples.ts` via `Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone`. Intentionally no editable UI in v1.
- ✅ `voice-entries` Storage bucket (private).
- ✅ 5 Storage RLS policies on `storage.objects` mirroring locked-reveal logic.
- ✅ Path scheme: `{couple_plan_id}/{day_number}/{user_id}.m4a`.
- ✅ Fixed latent infinite-recursion bug in `entries_select_partner_after_mutual_submit` (self-referencing subquery). Migration: `fix_entries_rls_recursion_and_refactor_storage_helpers`. Now uses SECURITY DEFINER helpers.
- ✅ 4-stage RLS smoke test passed.
- ✅ Test for timezone capture in `couples.test.ts`.

### Weekend 7: Voice journaling (code-complete 2026-05-28)

- ✅ Installed `expo-audio` (~56.0.11), `expo-file-system` (~56.0.7), `base64-arraybuffer` (^1.0.2).
- ✅ `expo-audio` plugin configured in `app.json` with custom mic permission string.
- ✅ API surface verified against installed `.d.ts` (not memory): `useAudioRecorder`, `useAudioRecorderState`, `useAudioPlayer`, `useAudioPlayerStatus`, `RecordingPresets.HIGH_QUALITY`, `setAudioModeAsync`.
- ✅ `src/lib/entries.ts` extended with `ensureVoiceDraft`, `uploadVoiceRecording`, `attachAudioToEntry`, `getSignedAudioUrl`. Upload via new `File.arrayBuffer()` with `expo-file-system/legacy` base64 fallback.
- ✅ `src/components/VoiceRecorder.tsx`: permission flow, 5-min hard auto-stop, live timer, 32-bar metering waveform (null-safe), playback with re-record/send. Failure preserves recording on screen.
- ✅ Write/Voice toggle wired into journal screen.
- ✅ 39 tests passing (8 new for voice flow).
- ⏳ **On-device validation pending** — voice flow has not been recorded/uploaded/revealed end-to-end yet.

### Weekend 8: Streaks (SHIPPED — see "Phase 4 — Streaks" section below)

- ⏳ `calculate-streak` Edge Function with timezone-aware midnight.
- ⏳ Rolling 30-day window freeze-day logic (3 forgivable misses).
- ⏳ Streak visualization on Home screen.

---

## iOS dev build (Xcode 26 / Swift 6) — RUNNING

The biggest event of the 2026-05-28 session. Apple has tightened the Swift compiler faster than Expo SDK 56 ships with. Full debugging log in [trial-and-error.md](trial-and-error.md).

What's working:
- ✅ Custom dev client builds and installs on Christian's iPhone with a free Apple ID
- ✅ Bundle ID: `com.christianmangwanda.pamwe`
- ✅ Entitlements stripped (no Push, no Apple Sign In — both unsupported on personal teams)
- ✅ CocoaPods works once `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8` is set in `~/.bash_profile`
- ✅ Trust verification succeeds on cellular (not all Wi-Fi networks can reach Apple's `ppq.apple.com`)
- ✅ App boots cleanly, all Expo modules register, Metro bundle loads
- ✅ Patches applied to `node_modules/expo-modules-jsi/`:
  - `weak let` → `weak var` in 15 places
  - `@unchecked Sendable` on HostFunctionContext, HostObjectContext, JavaScriptValue, JavaScriptPropNameID
  - **Package.swift and JavaScriptType protocol left untouched** — touching them breaks symbol ABI and dyld can't resolve

What's NOT yet working / blocked:
- ⏳ Magic link auth via real email — Supabase URL config (Site URL = `pamwe://`) not yet validated end-to-end. Hit rate limit during attempts.
- ⏳ Apple Sign In — won't work, free Apple ID.
- ⏳ Partner push notifications on iOS — no APNs key (paid account required). Database webhook still fires; edge function still runs; no banner on phone.

Dev sign-in workaround (created 2026-05-28):
- `alice@pamwe.dev` / `dev-password` — Partner A
- `bob@pamwe.dev` / `dev-password` — Partner B
- Paired in couple `cccccccc-cccc-cccc-cccc-cccccccccccc`, enrolled in M'Cheyne day 1
- `__DEV__`-gated buttons on `src/app/(auth)/sign-in.tsx`

---

## Open work, ranked by priority (as of 2026-06-06)

Most of the old list is now **done** — John seed finished, Phase 4 streaks shipped, Settings built, couples realtime wired. What actually remains:

1. **On-device validation pass (highest priority, no money required).** The whole app has been built and verified in code + via transactional DB tests, but the device-only behaviors have never run end-to-end on a real iPhone:
   - Core ritual: sign in → Today → record voice as Christian → switch to Bob → record → reveal plays both → day advances → streak bars fill.
   - Plan completion: finish the 21-day John plan → completion screen → choose next plan.
   - Prayers (Phase 5): add a prayer as Alice → appears live for Bob → both tap "prayed today" → mark answered → archive.
   - Settings: toggle notif prefs; deny OS notifications and confirm the recovery banner + deep link.
   - Account deletion: run **both** directions (A deletes vs B deletes), confirm the survivor keeps their data and lands on a usable waiting screen with a fresh invite code.
2. **Apple Developer enrollment ($99/yr).** Gates real APNs push (all webhooks fire today but no banner delivers on the free Apple ID), Sign In with Apple, and TestFlight/App Store. Hard external blocker for Phases 7–8.
3. **Magic-link auth via real email** — Supabase Site URL (`pamwe://`) config never validated end-to-end (hit the rate limit, pivoted to dev users).
4. **Phase 7 — Ship Prep** (renumbered, was Phase 6): onboarding polish, splash pronunciation guide, App Store screenshots/metadata, marketing page, EAS Build → TestFlight, crash monitoring.
5. **Phase 8 — Launch**: TestFlight feedback, RevenueCat (paywall off for the 90-day free period), per-couple entitlement, App Store submission.
6. **Build-your-own plan UI** — schema supports it (`plans.created_by`); deferred to its own post-launch phase (needs a bundled WEB dataset + prompt strategy, per Decision 3 in [phase6-completeness.md](phase6-completeness.md)).
7. **Seed more curated plans** — NT-in-30, Psalms-in-30, etc. Same offline-fetcher → dashboard-paste pattern.

### Live backend inventory (Supabase `freftpwigrkjytusnqhx`)

- **Edge Functions:** `notify-partner`, `notify-new-prayer`, `notify-freeze`, `delete-account`.
- **Realtime publication:** `entries`, `prayers`, `prayer_marks`, `couples`, `couple_plans`.
- **Triggers on `entries`:** `notify_partner_on_submit_trigger`, `advance_plan_day_trigger` (now also flips `status='completed'` on the final day), `update_streak_on_mutual_submit_trigger` (now fires the freeze "fresh start" webhook).
- **Trigger on `prayers`:** `notify_partner_on_new_prayer_trigger`.
- **New column:** `prayers.notify_partner` (per-prayer toggle).

## Recently completed (2026-05-29)

- ✅ Wired up `patch-package`. Patches in `patches/expo-modules-jsi+56.0.7.patch` (204 lines, 14 Swift source files). Auto-applies via `postinstall` script in package.json.
- ✅ **Tier 1 bug fixes:**
  - Sign-in `setLoading(false)` on success paths (Google + Apple) — no more spinner-stuck after auth.
  - `index.tsx` auth gate refactored with `useCallback` + session-id dep; `getUserCouple(userId?)` accepts the cached user id from the session so no extra `supabase.auth.getUser()` network round-trip.
  - DB trigger `advance_plan_day_trigger` on `entries` AFTER INSERT/UPDATE OF submitted_at — bumps `couple_plans.current_day` when both partners have submitted for the same day. Idempotent. Migration: `advance_plan_day_on_mutual_submit`. Smoke-tested with a synthetic two-submit sequence in a transaction.
  - New [src/components/AudioPlayer.tsx](src/components/AudioPlayer.tsx) — fetches signed URL via `getSignedAudioUrl`, wraps `expo-audio` `useAudioPlayer`/`useAudioPlayerStatus`. Reveal screen now renders it for voice entries (mine + partner), falls back to text rendering for `entry_type='text'`.
- ✅ **Tier 2 content management:**
  - `switchPlan(coupleId, newPlanId)` in `src/lib/plans.ts`. Marks active plan completed, enrolls in new plan at day 1.
  - `plan-select.tsx` accepts `?mode=change` query param. In switch mode: confirmation alert, "Switch to this plan" CTA, no auto-select.
  - "Change plan" ghost button on Today home → navigates to `(onboarding)/plan-select?mode=change`.
  - **Gospel of John (21 days)** plan partially seeded: plan row + day 1 inserted via migration. Remaining days 2–21 (~100KB of SQL) are at `/tmp/john_remaining.sql` and need a one-shot paste into Supabase SQL editor: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/freftpwigrkjytusnqhx/sql/new
- ✅ 39/39 tests still pass; typecheck clean on touched files.
- ✅ **Bible browser tab added.** New routes under `src/app/(tabs)/bible/`:
  - `index.tsx` — searchable book picker (66 books, OT + NT sections)
  - `[book].tsx` — chapter picker grid for a book
  - `[book]/[chapter].tsx` — chapter reader with Prev/Next nav
  - All powered by `src/lib/bible.ts` which fetches on-demand from bible-api.com (WEB translation, no seed needed). 66-book canonical metadata included.
  - Tab order now Today / Bible / Prayers.

## Phase 3 backend verification + security sweep (2026-05-28)

Ran through the Phase 3 backend state via the Supabase MCP and confirmed everything is live:

- ✅ Edge Function `notify-partner` deployed (v1, `verify_jwt: false`, byte-for-byte match with [supabase/functions/notify-partner/index.ts](supabase/functions/notify-partner/index.ts))
- ✅ Realtime publication includes `public.entries` (waiting-screen subscription will fire)
- ✅ `pg_net` v0.20.3 installed
- ✅ DB triggers: `notify_partner_on_submit_trigger` calls Edge Function on submission; `advance_plan_day_trigger` bumps `current_day` on mutual submit
- ✅ `users.expo_push_token`, `notification_partner`, `notification_morning_time` columns exist

**Security advisor sweep — addressed:**
- `handle_new_user`: pinned `search_path = public, pg_temp` (was mutable, lint 0011)
- `handle_new_user`, `rls_auto_enable`: revoked anon/authenticated EXECUTE (operational, not user-facing)
- `has_user_submitted_entry`, `can_view_partner_audio`, `current_user_couple_id`: revoked **anon** EXECUTE (previously callable by unauthenticated requests via `/rest/v1/rpc/...`)
- Kept **authenticated** EXECUTE on those three — they're referenced by RLS policies `entries_select_partner_after_mutual_submit`, `voice_entries_select_partner_after_reveal`, `users_select_partner`. Revoking authenticated breaks the locked reveal.

**Tech debt resolved (re-audit 2026-05-28):** re-read the three helper bodies and they're already self-protected. `has_user_submitted_entry` requires `auth.uid() = p_user_id` so you can only probe your own state. `can_view_partner_audio` requires `me.user_id = auth.uid() AND me.submitted_at IS NOT NULL` so you must have personally submitted before the function returns anything useful. `current_user_couple_id` returns the caller's own couple_id (which they already have via `users_select_own`). RPC access to these doesn't leak anything beyond what RLS already permits. Added `COMMENT ON FUNCTION` to each documenting the rationale so this doesn't get re-flagged. **Not moving to a private schema** — cosmetic, not protective.

**Open (dashboard-only):** HaveIBeenPwned leaked-password protection. Dashboard → Authentication → Policies → Password Strength.

## Phase 4 — Streaks (started 2026-05-28)

**Streak system shipped** (DB trigger, not Edge Function or cron — the streak is self-correcting on next submit).

- New function: `public.update_streak_on_mutual_submit()`. SECURITY DEFINER, `search_path = public, pg_temp`, EXECUTE revoked from anon/authenticated.
- New trigger: `update_streak_on_mutual_submit_trigger` on `entries` AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OF `submitted_at`.
- Computes "today" via `couples.timezone` (the device-derived value captured at couple creation).
- Idempotent: same-day re-fire after partner's second submit is a no-op (guarded on `streak_last_date = today_date`).
- Freeze logic: 3 freezes per rolling 30-day window. Gap-day delta vs `streak_last_date` is bridged by freezes when available; if not, streak resets to 1.
- **Per Christian's preference, freeze use is silent.** No UI affordance, no notification — `freeze_days_used` just ticks up on the couple row.

Smoke-tested with a 4-case transactional DO block against the dev couple (alice + bob, America/New_York):
1. First mutual submit → streak=1 ✅
2. Yesterday → today → streak=2 ✅
3. 2-day gap with freezes available → streak=3, freezes_used=1 ✅
4. 4-day gap with only 1 freeze left → streak resets to 1, freezes_used=0 ✅

All assertions passed; final `RAISE EXCEPTION` discarded the test data. Couple state confirmed back to zeroes after rollback. No production impact.

**Home screen** already reads `streak_count` from the `couples` row via the `useCouple` provider; the 7-bar `<StreakBar>` row will start filling in as submissions land.

**Phase 4 leftovers** (deferred):
- Voice journaling — already shipped previously (`VoiceRecorder`, `AudioPlayer`, `voice-entries` bucket, storage RLS).
- Freeze-day notification ("Yesterday was a freeze-day. Today is a fresh start.") — punted to polish.

## Phase 5 — Prayers tab (Weekends 10–11): SHIPPED (2026-06-06)

Second tab built end-to-end. Replaced the "Coming soon" placeholder.

**Data layer** — [src/lib/prayers.ts](src/lib/prayers.ts), mirrors `entries.ts`:
- `getPrayers(coupleId, status)` / `getAnsweredPrayers(coupleId)` — ordered by `created_at` (active) or `answered_at` (answered).
- `createPrayer(coupleId, text, notifyPartner)` — author = current user.
- `getTodayMarks(timezone)` — both partners' marks for today (RLS-scoped to couple).
- `markPrayedFor(prayerId, timezone)` — idempotent upsert (`ignoreDuplicates`), one per user/prayer/day.
- `markAnswered(prayerId, note?)`.
- "Today" derived from `couples.timezone` (same source as the streak system) so insert and read agree on the calendar day regardless of device UTC offset.

**Screens** — Prayers tab converted from a single file to a stack ([src/app/(tabs)/prayers/](src/app/(tabs)/prayers/)):
- `index.tsx` — Active/Answered segmented toggle, FlatList of `PrayerCard`, pull-to-refresh, empty states. Realtime: one channel with two `postgres_changes` listeners (`prayers` filtered by `couple_id`, `prayer_marks` unfiltered) + `useFocusEffect` reload. "Mark answered" uses `Alert.prompt` on iOS (optional note), plain confirm on Android.
- `add.tsx` — modal sheet (`presentation: 'modal'`): 280-char textarea, char count, **Notify your partner** `Switch` (default on), Add button.
- The **Answered archive** is the "Answered" position of the toggle — no separate route (simplicity).
- [src/components/PrayerCard.tsx](src/components/PrayerCard.tsx) — author label (You/Your partner), date, "I prayed today" pill (shows "You prayed today" / "You both prayed today"), Mark answered action; answered cards show the optional note.

**Backend:**
- `prayers.notify_partner` boolean column added (default true) — the per-prayer toggle.
- Edge Function `notify-new-prayer` deployed (v1, `verify_jwt=false`), mirrors `notify-partner`. Pushes an 80-char preview to the partner.
- Trigger `notify_partner_on_new_prayer_trigger` on `prayers` AFTER INSERT → `net.http_post` to the function, gated on `NEW.notify_partner`. Mirrors `notify_partner_on_submit`.
- `prayers` + `prayer_marks` added to the `supabase_realtime` publication.
- Migration: `phase5_prayers_notify_and_realtime` (applied via MCP).

Smoke-tested the insert → mark → answer flow in a transactional DO block against the dev couple; rolled back, both tables confirmed back to 0 rows. 39/39 tests still pass; typecheck clean on touched files.

**On-device validation pending** — add a prayer as Alice, confirm it appears live for Bob, both tap "I prayed today", mark answered, check archive. Real APNs push still won't deliver on the free Apple ID (webhook fires, no banner) — same as `notify-partner`.

---

## Phase 6 — Completeness (2026-06-06): SHIPPED (code-complete, on-device validation pending)

Built to the done criteria in [phase6-completeness.md](phase6-completeness.md) (the spec, reconciled against the live schema before building — its account-deletion design was corrected from "delete the couples row" to "demote, never delete," because the cascade chain `couples → couple_plans → entries` / `couples → prayers → prayer_marks` would have wiped the surviving partner's data).

**Tier 0 — unblocks**
- John plan confirmed fully seeded (21/21 days, all with passage_text + prompt). No paste needed.
- HaveIBeenPwned: confirmed moot — production auth is passwordless (magic link + Apple); the only `signInWithPassword` is `__DEV__`-gated. Left disabled intentionally.

**Tier 1 — required surfaces**
- **Plan completion.** Trigger `advance_plan_day_if_mutual_submit()` now sets `couple_plans.status='completed'` when the final day is mutually submitted (was silently clamping `current_day`, leaving a dead reveal loop). Migration `phase6_mark_plan_completed_on_final_day`; transactionally smoke-tested (John day 21 → completed). New [complete.tsx](src/app/(tabs)/(today)/complete.tsx) celebration screen (days / reflections / streak stats), reached from the reveal screen's final-day CTA. Today's no-plan state rewritten from "something went wrong" to a graceful "Ready for what's next → Choose a plan."
- **Settings screen** ([settings.tsx](src/app/(tabs)/(today)/settings.tsx)), reached via a ⚙ in the Today header. Owns sign out (now routes to `/`), change plan, and notification prefs (morning-time presets, partner + prayer toggles) wired to `users.notification_morning_time/notification_partner/notification_prayer`, with a permission-denied recovery banner (`Linking.openSettings()`). Removed the ghost "Change plan" and `__DEV__` sign-out from Today.
- **Account deletion** — demote-don't-delete. Edge Function `delete-account` (verify_jwt=true, authenticates caller): deletes the user's own marks/entries/prayers, demotes the couple (promotes the survivor into the NOT NULL `partner_a` slot when needed, regenerates a fresh invite code), notifies the partner, then `auth.admin.deleteUser` (cascades `public.users`). Confirmation screen [delete-account.tsx](src/app/(tabs)/(today)/delete-account.tsx) + double confirm. Lib [src/lib/account.ts](src/lib/account.ts). Demote logic transactionally verified: partner B's data survives, couple row intact, survivor promoted.

**Tier 2 — consistency**
- `couples` + `couple_plans` added to the realtime publication (migration `phase6_realtime_couples`); onboarding [waiting.tsx](src/app/(onboarding)/waiting.tsx) now subscribes to `couples` UPDATEs (10s poll → realtime + 30s fallback).
- **Freeze-day "fresh start" ping.** Edge Function `notify-freeze` + a webhook added to the freeze-bridge branch of `update_streak_on_mutual_submit()` (migration `phase6_freeze_fresh_start_notification`). Fires only when a freeze is actually consumed; the freeze itself stays silent. Gentle, non-punishing copy to both partners.

**Tier 3 — finished feel**
- Home no-plan state done (above). Prayers/answered empty states already shipped in Phase 5.
- Prayer write paths: `createPrayer`/`markAnswered` already alerted; `markPrayedFor` was optimistic+silent — now reverts and surfaces a gentle alert on failure.

**Status:** typecheck clean on touched files; 39/39 tests pass; security advisor shows no new issues (only the 3 long-documented RLS helper functions + the moot HIBP toggle). New edge functions: `notify-new-prayer` (Phase 5), `delete-account`, `notify-freeze`.

**On-device validation pending (needs a real iPhone + dev client):**
- Finish the John plan end-to-end → completion screen → choose next plan.
- Settings: toggle prefs, deny OS notifications and confirm the recovery banner + deep link.
- Account deletion **both directions** (partner A deletes vs partner B deletes); confirm survivor keeps data and is routed to the unpaired/waiting state with a usable invite code.
- Real push delivery for `delete-account`/`notify-freeze` still blocked on Apple Developer / APNs (webhooks fire; no banner on free Apple ID), same as all other pushes.

## Phase 7 — Ship Prep (started 2026-06-10)

First pass: everything that needs no money and no device. 39/39 tests pass; `npx tsc --noEmit` is now fully clean repo-wide (was app/lib-only).

- **eas.json** created (development / preview / production profiles, remote app version source). Still needs a one-time `eas init` (Expo account login) to stamp the project ID into app.json.
- **Crash reporting scaffolded.** `@sentry/react-native` installed (RNSentry 8.13.0, pods linked), env-gated init + `Sentry.wrap` in [src/app/_layout.tsx](src/app/_layout.tsx) — a no-op until `EXPO_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` is set in `.env`. New `metro.config.js` uses `getSentryExpoConfig` (debug IDs for symbolication). Remaining: create the Sentry account, set the DSN, rebuild the dev client, and add `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` to EAS for source map upload.
- **Reveal dead-end fixed.** [reveal.tsx](src/app/(tabs)/(today)/reveal.tsx) returned `null` (blank screen) if entries failed to load; now shows a spinner while loading and a "Couldn't load your reflections" card with retry. `useTodayEntry` exposes an `error` flag; the waiting screen shows a gentle "retrying" hint on fetch failure (the 30s fallback poll self-heals).
- **Privacy Policy + Terms of Use** as real in-app screens ([privacy.tsx](src/app/(tabs)/(today)/privacy.tsx), [terms.tsx](src/app/(tabs)/(today)/terms.tsx)) linked from a new About section in Settings. Same text can be pasted to a hosted page for the App Store Connect privacy-policy URL later.
- **Onboarding polish.** Welcome screen now carries the pronunciation line (pah-mweh — "together" in Shona) and a three-step Read / Reflect / Reveal explainer.
- **Accessibility pass.** `Button` primitive sets `accessibilityRole`/`Label`; the Today gear icon is labeled; Prayers + journal segmented tabs expose selected state; Settings switches are labeled. (VoiceRecorder/AudioPlayer already had labels.)
- **Housekeeping.** `tsconfig` now includes `"types": ["jest", "node"]` so test files typecheck; deleted dead Expo-template files `src/components/app-tabs(.web).tsx` (referenced the removed `/explore` route); `.gitignore` now covers `.env` and the stray personal files in the working dir (SteriCycle/, PDFs, `CLAUDE 2.md`).

**Remaining Phase 7:** Apple Developer enrollment (external blocker) → EAS build → TestFlight; App Store screenshots + metadata; marketing page; Sentry account + DSN; magic-link Site URL validation; the on-device validation pass.

### Second pass (2026-06-11) — last of the no-money code work

- **Notification tap routing.** All four push payloads now carry `data.type` (`partner_entry` + `reveal` flag, `prayer`, `freeze`, `partner_left`; the local morning notification sends `morning`). New [src/hooks/usePushRouting.ts](src/hooks/usePushRouting.ts) (uses `useLastNotificationResponse`, covers warm taps + cold starts, dedupes by notification id), mounted in [(tabs)/_layout.tsx](src/app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx) so routing only happens after the auth gate lands a signed-in, paired user. Routes: reveal-ready partner pushes → reveal screen, otherwise Today; prayer → Prayers tab; freeze/morning → Today; partner-left → `/` (auth gate re-evaluates).
- **Edge function deploys:** `notify-freeze` (v2) and `delete-account` (v2) redeployed with the data payloads, verify_jwt preserved. ⚠️ `notify-partner` and `notify-new-prayer` redeploys were blocked by the local permission layer — local sources are updated and ready; redeploy is the one pending backend step (tap routing falls back to opening the app normally until then).
- **Voice/text submit error hints.** [journal.tsx](src/app/(tabs)/(today)/journal.tsx) now detects network failures and says so ("You look offline. Your recording is still here…") instead of surfacing raw error messages; draft/recording preservation is stated in both paths.
- **Splash background** switched from template Expo blue `#208AEF` to the Pamwe parchment `#EFE6D6` in app.json.
- ⚠️ **App icon is still the Expo template default** (blue "A", confirmed visually) — needs a real Pamwe icon before TestFlight. Design work, not code; `assets/images/icon.png` (1024×1024) is the slot, also used for the notification icon, plus `assets/expo.icon` for iOS 26.

**Code-complete means code-complete now:** the only remaining feature code is RevenueCat (Phase 8), deliberately deferred until App Store Connect products exist so the integration can be verified against real offerings instead of written blind. Everything else left requires the Apple Developer account, a Sentry account, a designed app icon, or a physical device.

### Design/UX elevation pass (2026-06-11, same day)

Two parallel review agents audited every screen for premium-feel gaps and design-system consistency. Implemented the clear wins:

- **Partner presence.** New `getPartnerProfile()` + `profileInitial()` in [src/lib/couples.ts](src/lib/couples.ts) (uses the existing `users_select_partner` RLS policy; `avatar_initial`/`display_name`/`email` fallback chain). `CoupleProvider` now exposes `partner`. The hardcoded "?" on home + onboarding-waiting avatars and the "P" on the reveal screen are now the partner's real initial. `myInitial` uppercased consistently.
- **The reveal moment is celebrated.** Reveal cards enter with a staggered fade-down (mine, then partner's at +300ms, reanimated `FadeInDown`) and a success haptic fires when both unlock. Plan-complete screen fires a success haptic on mount; "I prayed today" gives a light impact tap. `expo-haptics` installed (pods linked — same rebuild as Sentry).
- **Dark mode hole closed.** `userInterfaceStyle` was `"automatic"` with a light-only palette (system Alerts/Switches/keyboard would have gone dark over parchment). Now `"light"`.
- **13 dead Expo-template files deleted** (themed-text/view, hint-row, web-badge, collapsible, external-link, animated-icon ×3, use-color-scheme ×2, use-theme, constants/theme.ts) — all verified unreferenced; only live code remains in src/.
- **Missing states filled:** Prayers list shows a spinner during first load (was blank); plan-select shows a "couldn't load plans" + retry state when `getPlans()` returns nothing; home gets pull-to-refresh (refreshes entries + couple/streak).
- **Small fixes:** invite screen wrapped in `KeyboardAvoidingView`; waiting-screen error hint warmed ("We can't reach the server right now — we'll keep trying"); journal's hardcoded rgba overlay → `colors.bgOverlay` token.

Deliberately NOT done (judgment calls, logged for Christian): tab-bar glyph icons (✶ ☩ ♡) vs real icons, dark mode as a feature, ScreenHeader/ToggleRow component extraction, spacing-constants refactor, a back affordance on the reading screen, "discard recording" on VoiceRecorder, streak visual past 7 days, waiting-screen "checking…" shimmer.

39/39 tests, typecheck clean.
